# Policy Template

Intro
-----

This is a simple template to help you think through writing a policy. It was designed in the context of the IT industry with the goal of supporting best pracitces but it can be used in any industry. Using this will make writing a policy easier, but I don't promise that that you'll make a good or accurate policy just because you use it.

Note: Some organisations may have a required template to apply for policy writing. including required training. Some places have (very specific) rules about what you are and aren't allowed to do with policies. You should confirm your constraints and the policy should definitely be reviewed by the appropriate groups.

Goal of this Repository
----

Promote good policy writing and implementation of policies.

Avoid continued propagation of boring, long and useless policies that nobody wants to read and serve little value.

Using the Template
-----

Copy the template into your preferred management tool for policies.
Note that in some organisations, the policy can exist as a simple HTML or markdown page. In others, it must be entered into a version controlled tool and reference various (ISO) controls to cover GRC requirements.
