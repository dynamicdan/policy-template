# Policy Template
=======================

Intro
-----

This is a simple template to help you think through writing a policy. It was designed in the context of the IT industry with the goal of supporting best pracitces but it can be used in any industry. Using this will make writing a policy easier, but I don't promise that that you'll make a good or accurate policy just because you use it.

Note: Some instituations may have a required template to apply for policy writing. including required training. Some places have (very specific) rules about what you are and aren't allowed to do with policies. You should confirm your constraints and the policy should definitely be reviewed by the appropriate groups.
